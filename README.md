# Route Traversal with Neo4J and Clojure

A demo on using Neocons Clojure REST wrapper for Neo4J using Translink/NIRailways stations and an example route.

## Installation

Clone the repo and use leiningen to build and run. Can run via the REPL with no issues.

You will require the community edition of Neo4J as well. Install and run the server then you can run the code.

## Current Status

It's work in progress, I'm just building this as I get time and it will end up a blog post at some point.
